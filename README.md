PoN PC is a native Windows PC port of the previously mobile-exclusive game *Rockman EXE Phantom of Network*. This port allows the game to be played with no emulator required. The original game's assets, however, are still required to run the port.

## Features
In addition to being fully-playable on PC the port also features:
1. Built-in render scaling.
1. Rebound keys to intuitively match the original GBA games' buttons. These keys can also be remapped in-game.
1. Compatibility with the unofficial English fan translation.
1. Compatibility with the unofficial leaderboard for online ranked virus battle mode.

## Playing The Game
**You will need to obtain the original Japanese i-αppli game files for *Rockman EXE Phantom of Network* in order to play this port. These files are not included in this download. Please refer to [SciLab Secrets](https://twitter.com/ScilabSecrets) on how to obtain these game files.**

After obtaining the original game's files, proceed depending on your choice of language.
